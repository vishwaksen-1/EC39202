In this repository I want to write and save the lab experiment codes for **EC39202 -- Embedded Systems Laboratory** course at **IIT Kharagpur** for reference to juniors.
I am from the **22 batch**.

The repository includes the following:

### Misc
Miscellaneous codes and notes (for those that actually want to learn 🙂)

### Problem Statements
Lab Problem Statements

### Solutions
Solutions to the lab problems

### Datasheets
Datasheets for the components used in the labs (Given by the instructors)

### _Data
Schematics for the circuits used in the labs (not Given by the instructors)

### Links
Additional Links and resources used by us for the lab

#### **Note:** 
As you progress through the experiments, you'll notice a decline in the level of detailed guidance provided. This is intentional, starting from fully detailed Experiment 1 to minimal support by Experiment 5. This approach encourages independent learning. The purpose of this repository is simply to help you achieve a decent grade, not a top one. Remember, true learning is a personal journey, not a lecture. 

**P.S.:** Feel free to NOT use this repository entirely. Learn the "Thing".
