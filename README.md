#### **Note:** 
As you progress through the experiments, you'll notice a decline in the level of detailed guidance provided, and integrity of the code(Codes get shabbier and shabbier losing elegance little by little, but still work). This is intentional, starting from fully detailed Experiment 1 to minimal support by Experiment 5. This approach encourages independent learning. The purpose of this repository is simply to help you achieve a decent grade. Remember, true learning is a personal journey, not a lecture/copyable repo üôÇ. 

**P.S.:** Feel free to NOT use this repository entirely. Learn the "Thing".
